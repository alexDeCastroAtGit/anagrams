# Anagrams appliaction

This is just a simple application for finding [anagrams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)
It's definitely not bulletproof, nor complete, but it works, and finds anagrams for you.

## Performance

There are two very simple optimizations I've used:
*  search anagrams by their letters sorted alphabetically 
    examples =>  (bat -> abt , tab -> abt)
*  add index on sorted_word column (which stores the words transformed as above)

## Time counting

There are two approaches to count time of requests
*  **File uploads** - I don't actually measure request times - all I'm doing is count how long it takes to parse the text file and insert the words to the database. In case I wanted to really get the time of the entire request I'd write a rack middleware for that. For now though I've decided to stick with the Simplest Thing That Could Workâ„¢. 
*  **Finding anagrams** - Here I'm using javascript to count the actual request times. It's easy to do here, since I'm using AJAX to for this requests.
